Introduction to Linux
======================

#### 1. **Linux history**

All modern operating systems have their roots in 1969 when Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson developed the C language and the Unix OS at AT&T lab. They shared their source code with the rest of the world. By 1975, when AT&T started selling Unix commercially, about half of the source code was written by the others. Many people who had contributed to Unix were not happy that the commercial company sold the software that had been written by them. The battle between AT&T and these people ended with two version of Unix: the official AT&T Unix and the free **BSD** Unix  
Development of BSD descendants like FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly BSD and PC-BSD is still active today.  

In the 1980s, many company created their own Unix, IBM created AIX, Sun: SunOS (later: Solaris), HP: HP-UX and about dozen other companies did the same. The result is a mess of Unix dialects and a dozen of different ways to do the same thing. And here is the first real root of Linux, when Richart Stallman aimed to end this era of Unix separation and everybody re-inventing the wheel by   
starting the **GNU** project. His aim was to make an operating system that freely available to everyone and where everyone could work together. Many of the commandline tools that you use on Linux today is GNU tools.  

The Nineties started with Linus Torvalds, a Swedish speaking Finnish student, buying a 386  computer  and  writing  a  brand  new  POSIX compliant kernel. He put the source code online, thinking it would never support anything but 386 hardware. Many people embraced the combination of this kernel with the GNU tools, and the rest, as they say, is history.  

Today more than 97 percent of the world's supercomputers (including the complete top 10), more than 80 percent of all smartphones, many millions of desktop computers, around 70 percent of all web servers, a large chunk of tablet computers, and several appliances (dvd-players, washing machines, dsl modems, routers, self-driving cars, space station laptops...) run Linux. Linux is by far the most commonly used operating system in the world. Linux kernel version 4.0 was released in April 2015. Its source code grew by several hundred thousand lines (compared to version 3.19 from February 2015) thanks to contributions of thousands of developers  paid  by  hundreds  of  commercial  companies  including  Red  Hat, Intel,  Samsung,  Broadcom,  Texas  Instruments,  IBM,  Novell,  Qualcomm,  Nokia,  Oracle, Google, AMD and even Microsoft (and many more).

#### 2. **Distributions**

A Linux distribution is a collection of (usually open source) software on top of a Linuxkernel. A distribution (or short, distro) can bundle server software, system  management tools,  documentation and many desktop  applications in a central secure software
repository. A distro aims to  provide a common look and feel, secure and easy software management and often a specific operational purpose.  
Let's take a look at some popular distributions.

* Read Hat: Red Hat is a billion dollar commercial Linux company that puts a lot of effort in developing Linux. They have hundreds of Linux specialists and are known for their excellent support. They give their products (Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora) away for free. While Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is well tested before release and supported for up to sevenyears after release, Fedora is a distro with faster updates but without support.
* Ubuntu: Canonical started sending out free compact discs with Ubuntu Linux in 2004 and quickly became  popular  for  home  users  (many  switching  from  Microsoft  Windows).  Canonical wants  Ubuntu  to  be  an  easy  to  use  graphical  Linux  desktop without need to ever see a command line. Of course they also want to make a profit by selling support for Ubuntu.
* Debian: There is no company behind Debian. Instead there are thousands of well organised developers that elect a Debian Project Leader every two years. Debian is seen as one of the most stable Linux distributions. It is also the basis of every release of Ubuntu. Debian comes in three versions: stable, testing and unstable. Every Debian release is named after a character in the movie Toy Story.
