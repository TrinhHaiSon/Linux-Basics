The Linux file tree
======================

### 1. **Filesystem hierarchy standard**

Many Linux distributions partially follow the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS). The FHS may help make more Unix/Linux file system trees conform better in the future. 
  
It is possible to define two independent distinctions among files: shareable vs. unshareable and variable vs. static. In general, files that differ in either of these respects should be located in different directories. This makes it easy to store files with different usage characteristics on different filesystems
